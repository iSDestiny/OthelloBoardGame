## Othello/Reversi Board Game
Othello/Reversi is a strategy board game for two players usually played on an 8x8 uncheckered board. In my implementation of the game, the board can be set up to be any even number of rows between 4 to 16 and any even number of columns between 4 to 16. You can also select who starts first, either black or white. The winning condition can also be set to be either the highest score winning or the lowest score winning, the score being how many tiles a player occupies. In order to begin the game, all these settings must be set before clicking start. One you click start from the settings menu it will then pop up the game board. You must first choose the starting positions of the black and white disks and once you have your desired board set up then you can play start. There are not any changes in the rules of the game, it's the same rules you can find on Wikipedia.
